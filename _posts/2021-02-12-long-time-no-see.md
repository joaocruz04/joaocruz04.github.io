LightningBits is back, after a few years without writing a single thing except meeting notes, and grocery shopping lists. 

Not because I had no time, but because I'm really like, super lazy. And now, after all these years, having a more demanding job and increased family by two toddlers, I decided to use my - now imaginary - free time to write about the stuff I find. Maybe it's the current pandemic, maybe it's the nice home office setup I have. Maybe I'm just hiding from my kids.

<i>What can go wrong, right?</i>

No but seriously, the main goal of restarting this blog is to make me sort my ideas better and hopefully get even better insights of the things I will share with you. Stay tuned. As soon as I stop procrastinating and finding new twists to the layout of this blog, <b>I will definitely write something nice</b>. I promise.
